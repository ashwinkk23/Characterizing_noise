# Codes for Figure 2

1. **Generate polarisation time-series for a given set of parameters:** A matlab code (/Figure_2/Gillespie_stochastic_process.m) can be used to compute the polarization/order parameter.
	1. The important parameters that need to be set are N (system size), r1, r2, r3, r4 (which are for different reaction rates).
